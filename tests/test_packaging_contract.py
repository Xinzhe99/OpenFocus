"""Packaging contract: one install, no capability tiers.

`pip install openfocus` must be a complete install. The AI method is the
default fusion choice, so an install that lacked torch was broken the moment
the window opened, and the `[ai]`/`[heic]`/`[raw]` extras meant a user could
not tell which capabilities they actually had. These tests pin the single
install so it cannot quietly fragment again.
